# phonebook

The phonebook program keeps a database of friends, their birthdates, and their phone numbers. You can add, find, and list all friends in the database.

We use a CSV file as a database. Each row contains a single record with the name, birthdate, and phone. The contents of the CSV file is loaded onto an array during execution, and its final contents is overwritten into the CSV file at program termination.
